# Experiencing HTML Lab

## Learning Goals
- How to write text for the web
- Create a complete HTML document
    1. Code an `h1` tag
    1. Code a `p` tag
    1. Add an `id` attribute

## Getting Started
Fork and clone this into your local environment. Navigate into its directory in your terminal, and then run `code .` to open files in Visual Studio Code. Run `npm install` to fetch this laboratory’s dependencies and run `npm test` as you go to see your test progress.

## Code an `h1` Tag
Open `index.html` in Visual Studio Code. Add the `h1` opening and closing tags.

## Set the Inner Text
Inside of the opening and closing `h1` tags, insert the text: `My First HTML Element`.

Check your progress by running `npm test`. Failing tests will provide helpful error messages that you can use to debug your code - read them closely for hints.

## Viewing Your HTML Document in the Browser
Open up the HTML document in your browser and watch how each change you make in the text editor affects the visual layout in the browser.

Once you have the HTML document open in your browser, you can make changes to it in a text editor, save the file, refresh the page in the browser, and see the changes.

## Add a `p` Tag
Now that you have successfully written your first HTML tag (the `h1` tag), add another element to your `index.html`. Add the `p` opening and closing tags.

Insert the text `A quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog` inside the opening and closing `p` tags. Run `npm test` and check the output in your browser.

## Add the `id` Attribute to Your `p` Tag
When you have successfully added the `p` tag, let’s add an `id` attribute to that `p` tag. This attribute specifies a unique id for an HTML element which can be used to target for styling (with CSS) and adding behavior (with JS).

Inside the opening `p` tag, write `id=””` and inside the quotation marks is where you’ll be specifying the value for the id attribute. Go ahead and write `firstParagraph` to it. Run `npm test` to check.

## Stretch Goal
Congratulations! You have successfully completed the Experiencing HTML Lab. Go ahead and tinker with this laboratory by adding a few heading elements (`h2` - `h6`) and some other `p` elements.
